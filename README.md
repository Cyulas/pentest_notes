# pentest_notes

An attempt to organize the notes I've taken during my time in working through TryHackMe, HacktheBox, and other CTF content. This is very much a work in progress and no guarantees are made to how accurate this content is. Needless to say this is for educational purposes only and you should never perform any commands, actions, or steps documented here on systems you are not authorized to perform testing on.
