# Introduction
An attempt to organize the notes I've taken during my time in working through TryHackMe, HacktheBox, and other CTF content. This is very much a work in progress and no guarantees are made to how accurate this content is. 

This is for educational purposes only and you should never perform any commands, actions, or steps documented here on systems you are not authorized to perform testing on. I have done my utmost to write these notes in my own words from the various training resources, however all credit should go to the content creators of the various rooms.

## Recon and Enumeration
Reconnaissance consists of both Passive and Active surveillance methods. It is the first phase in the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/#) and Ethical Hacking process.

### Passive Recon
Footprinting method used to collect information about a target without directly interacting with the target. Common methods might be using an intermediary that interacts with the target or already has information about the target. Tools like [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/), [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), [WHOIS](who.is), are examples of this.

### Active
Direct interaction with the company and services, such as visiting the company website or social media pages.

### Enumeration

Direct interaction with company resources in an effort to uncover information relavent to discovering vulnerabilities and additional means of gaining access.

- [HOST](/content/tools.md#host) - Host IP and Services Identification.
- [NMAP](/content/tools.md#nmap) - Commonly used tool for port scanning IP addresses and enumerating services / ports.
- [GoBuster](/content/tools.md#gobuster) - Webpage directory enumeration.
- [DNS](/content/enumeration.md#dns)
